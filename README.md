I love the DailyCodingProblems and this is part of my daily routine, to improve my skills.

Problem 1

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following Node class

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}
```
You can use Jest, for testing. The test should pass:

```javascript

const node = new TreeNode(
  'root',
  new TreeNode('left', new TreeNode('left.left'), new TreeNode('right'))
);
test('Checking if serialization and deserialization works', () => {
expect(deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val).toEqual('left.left'); // Jest is used for testing if serialization and deserialization is working properly
});
```
