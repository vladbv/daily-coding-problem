Problem 217

Problem Statement:

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Write a function is_happy that takes an integer n and returns True if it is a happy number, and False otherwise.
Example:

Input: n = 19
Output: True

'''

def is_happy(n):
    def get_next(number):
        total_sum = 0
        while number > 0:
            number, digit = divmod(number, 10)
            total_sum += digit ** 2
        return total_sum

    seen = set()
    while n != 1 and n not in seen:
        seen.add(n)
        n = get_next(n)

    return n == 1

# Example usage
print(is_happy(19))  # Output: True
