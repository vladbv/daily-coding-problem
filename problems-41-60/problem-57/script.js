// Problem 57
// This problem was asked by Google.
//
// You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters.
// Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically.
// That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.
//
// For example, given the following table:
// cba
// daf
// ghi
//
// This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:
// ca
// df
// gi
// So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.
//
// As another example, given the following table:
// abcdef
// Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).
//
// As another example, given the following table:
// zyx
// wvu
// tsr
// Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.
//
// O(NM) Time complexity
// O(1) Space complexity

// Returning the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically
// @param {char[][]} matrix

function colRemoved(matrix){
	if(matrix.length === 0 || matrix.length === 1) return 0;
	let count = 0;
	for(let c = 0; c < matrix[0].length; c++){
		for(let r = 0; r < matrix.length - 1; r++){
		const char = matrix[r][c];
			const nextChar = matrix[r + 1][c];
			if(char.localeCompare(nextChar) > 0) {
				count++;
				break;
			}
		}
	}
	return count;
}
