// Problem 52
// This problem was asked by Microsoft.
//
// Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
// The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.
//
// For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15],
// the longest increasing subsequence has length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.
//
// Best solution is N log N using a variation of binary search
// O(N^2) Time complexity
// O(N) Space complexity
// N is the length of the array

// Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array
// @param {int[]} nums
// @return {int}

        for(let j = 0; j < i; j++){
            // we need to compare index of j to our current number
            // this comparison means there is an increasing subsequence
